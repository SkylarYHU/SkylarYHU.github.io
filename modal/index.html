        “The Bernese Mountain Dog, often simply referred to as the Berner, is a
        large and powerful breed known for its friendly and gentle nature. This
        breed originates from the Swiss Alps, where it was originally used as a
        farm dog for herding cattle, pulling carts, and guarding property. The
        Bernese Mountain Dog's combination of strength, friendliness, and
        striking appearance makes it a beloved breed for many dog enthusiasts.”
